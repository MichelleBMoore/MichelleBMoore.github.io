<h1> Its always been hard.</h1>
<h3> A summery in response to <em>"Has design become too hard?"</em> by L. Jeffrey Zeldman </h3>
<h2> By Michelle Moore</h2>

<p>L.Jeffrey Zeldman, author of <em>Designing With Web Standards</em>, gives a persuasive argument <del hidden> on if about design and if it has be </del> on how creativity <mark>has been</mark> sucked out of design because of the <q>hellish treadmill of overly complicated tools</q> that designers have to master. He goes back a little in the designing timeline and explains that designing was always <s hidden>kind of a</s> challenge. As artists, we problem solve creative problems- even if the hurdle is high, we find away over. He states that before a designer would have to code, they would <q>pretend</q> that everyone’s monitors had the same aspect ratio. Back then and even now, <del hidden> things are being used on an abundance of systems </del> content is being viewed on a variety of different applications and systems. They would solve problem after problem only to encounter clients that had their own preferences, faulty operating systems, and more. Zeldman then talks about designing programs for multi-platform usage. <s hidden> He also goes on to talk about how also</s> Companies wanted a responsive web design. This code was too hard but Zeldman, throughout <ins> most of the </ins> article, asks almost rhetorical questions that mean the opposite in some ways.
</p>
<p>
As visual people, we are always confronted with challenges to overcome and grow. That is how we learn. <del hidden> But designing </del> Designing for multi-use becomes tricky when thinking about the <q>stress case</q> user. But it is not impossible. The heart of Zeldman's argument gets answered in the end of the article. He explains that there are <ins>many</ins> programs to code out there. They have varying uses and features that can help with the coding process. Whatever they want to <s hidden> make will</s> use to make the <s hidden> program </s> work is totally up to the artist. There are programs out in the market such as <abbr title="SASS is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension Language in the world"><b>SASS</b></abbr> and <abbr title="Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web"><b>Bootstrap</b></abbr> that are very popular. If a designer wants to learn something new thats great. If they want to stick with the tools that are working for them, then that is also great. No one can know everything there is about coding because there is so many programs out there. No one can know every framework out there. So its better to relax and design something useful and special. The fun will come back with the realization that <s hidden> not everything</s> you don't know everything. Artists create something out of nothing, so create and have fun doing it.</p>

<ul class="notes">
    <li>
		<p>In the early days of web design, beginning in 1995, pixels were not standardized between <abbr title="Personal Computer"> PC </abbr> and Macintosh; monitor aspect ratios were not standardized, period; and when we got a <strong>standardized layout language</strong> for the web, every browser supported it differently <i>for years</i>.</p> </li>

    <li><p>Later, when standards were better supported in browsers, some of us pretended that “everybody” had a <code>600 x 400 </code> monitor (and then an <code>800 x 600 </code>, and then <code>1024 x 768 </code>), but these too were consensual hallucinations. And even in those rose-colored fixed-width days, there was always a client or a QA tester whose user preference settings, outdated browser, or wonky operating system blew our carefully constructed fixed-width layouts to hell.</p></li>
